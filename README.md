## Feedback Analyzer Using Natural Language Processing for Quezon City Public Library – E- Government Section

QCPL Engagement consists of a queuing system and feedback analyzer using NLP. It also has a lot more but I’m bad at explaining so that’s all for the project description.

### Technologies

This is currently the technologies that we used, I'll update it soon when we add more to it.

- PHP
- MySQL
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- OpenAI API

And some more libraries or plugins that I probably forgot.


We based the sentiment score of emojis to [Emoji Sentiment Ranking v1.0](https://kt.ijs.si/data/Emoji_sentiment_ranking/?emoji) and the remarks to [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/).

I also used this great tool [PHP Sentiment Analyzer](https://github.com/davmixcool/php-sentiment-analyzer) to understand and predict sentiments in a sentence using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner).
